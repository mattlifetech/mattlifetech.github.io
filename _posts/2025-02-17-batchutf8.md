I have developed a Python script to batch convert text files into **UTF-8 Simplified Chinese**. This tool is useful for handling files in various encodings (GB2312, Big5, etc.) and ensuring consistency in text processing.

### Features:
- Supports multiple encodings (GB2312, Big5, Traditional Chinese, etc.)
- Converts all text files in a folder (including subfolders)
- Ensures all files are saved in **UTF-8 Simplified Chinese**
- Command-line based for easy batch processing
