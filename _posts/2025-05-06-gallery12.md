**Introduction:**

The **Stock Idea Assistant (SIA)** app empowers graphic designers by automating the process of generating creative visual references tailored to any theme. For this project, SIA was used to produce 90s nostalgia-themed graphics—bringing back the colors, vibes, and icons of a beloved era in pop culture. This tool helps designers quickly visualize and refine ideas for content like blog features, social media posts, or branding decks—all offline and copyright-conscious.
