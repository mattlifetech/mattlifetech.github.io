If you enjoy reading Chinese story text files on your Android device using **Moon+ Reader**, you may have noticed that the **Table of Contents (TOC)** does not always display correctly. This can be frustrating, especially when navigating lengthy novels with multiple chapters. Fortunately, there’s a simple fix for this issue.

## Why Is the Table of Contents Missing?
Moon+ Reader automatically detects chapter titles based on recognizable patterns in the text file. As long as your text file contains structured chapter headings (e.g., `第1章` or `Chapter 1`), the app should be able to generate a TOC. However, if your **Android system language is not set to Chinese**, the TOC might not appear as expected.

## How to Fix It

The issue is likely due to the system language settings. Follow these steps to resolve it:

1. Open **Moon+ Reader** & Go left tab (click top left 3 lines) then **Options** (gear icon at bottom left corner).
2. Change the language setting to **Simplified Chinese (简体中文)**.
3. Close and reopen your text file.

Now, the Table of Contents should automatically appear and function properly.

## Conclusion
If your Chinese story text files contain proper chapter markers but the TOC is not showing up in **Moon+ Reader**, simply switching the app language to **Simplified Chinese** can resolve the problem. This small tweak makes navigating your favorite novels much easier!

Happy reading!
