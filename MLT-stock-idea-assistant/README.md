## Requirements:
- Windows 11 with GPU (Ideally 12GB VRAM)

## FAQ
**Q: Can it run on Mac?**  
A: It is Windows-optimized and not work on Mac.

**Q: Do I need internet?**  
A: Its a standalone exe installation. When installation completed, only need internet for FTP upload e.g. Dreamstime.

**Q: What AI model is used?**

## Known Limitations
- Not optimized for mobile workflows (desktop only)
